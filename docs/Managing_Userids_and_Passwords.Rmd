## Introduction

This guide will help you set up users and credentials for the Risk Assessment App. Some of these instructions apply only to the first time the app is run while others are for any time new users need to be added.

## First time running the app

### Keyring password

The first time the application is run (and only then), a prompt will ask you to create a keyring password.

<center>

![](images/create_keyring.png){width=400px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}

</center>

The keyring password entered here will allow a user to view/retrieve username and password values from the credentials database at a later time. As such, it is extremely important to store it in a safe place.

### Default user

After creating the keyring password, the login prompt appears. The app is initially set up with one username, **admin**, and a default password of **qwerty**. Type in these credentials (as seen below) to login with administrator authority.

<center>

![](images/initial_authentication_page.png){width=400px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}

</center>

The user will be immediately prompted to change the password for the **admin** username:

<center>

![](images/change_password.png){width=400px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}

</center>

<br>

## Administrator mode 

Only users with administrator privileges can add/delete/modify user accounts. To verify you have access to the administrator mode, hover your cursor over the plus `r fa("plus")` symbol in the bottom-right corner of the app. Upon clicking, additional options should appear. If present, the Administrator mode button will appear on top, as seen below.

<center>

![](images/admin_mode_button.png){width=750px style="margin: 10px 0 10px 0"}

</center>

This button will not be appear for non-admin users.

<br>

<br>

### Adding users

Two tables are presented. The first one is used to manage users, and the second one to manage passwords.

<center>

</center>

<br> 

Now would be a good time to add users! At the top of the **Users** table, click the long blue button labelled: "Add a user".
 
<center>

![](images/add_user_bar.png){width=750px}

</center>

<br>

A prompt will appear where you can specify a user name and **optional** start & expire dates which by default are set at today's date (more on those later). A check box to grant the new user administrator authority is also checked by default. A custom password is generated which requires changing the first time the new user logs in. Here, we'll type in a example user name "PeterParker".
 
<center>

![](images/add_user.png){width=750px}

</center>

<br>

Upon submission, a confirmation message will appear, so you can notify the user and send them his/her temporary password.</br>
 
<center>

</center>
   
## User `start` and `expire` dates

If the **start** date is set to a future date or the **expire** date is set to *before* today's date, an "account expired" message will appear, and the log in attempt will fail.

<br>

As an administrator, you can set either or both of these dates or just leave
them blank.

## Managing users

The first table allows adding, editing, and deleting users.

<center>

![](images/users_table.png){width=750px}

</center>

<br>

### Edit current user

Edit a user information by clicking on the blue <a style="color:blue">*edit*</a> button, found on the right-hand side of the table.

<br>

### Delete a user

Delete any user by clicking on the red <a style="color:red">*remove*</a> button, also on the right-hand side of the table.

<br>


## Replace initial `Admin` user

As an administrator, it's recommended you replace your initial `admin` user ID with one unique to you. Note that there must always be at least one admin user, so **you cannot delete yourself** at first.  If you want to delete the initial `admin` user you will need to create another user ID first with administrative privileges, as described below.


Click the blue "Add a user" button and make sure to check the `Admin` box. The temporary password can be overridden by un-checking the "ask to change password" box.

<br>

<center>

</center>

<br>

After completing the form, sign in using your new credentials and delete the original `admin` user by clicking the red <a style="color:red">remove</a> button.

<br>


## Password management

The second table allows for password management.

<center>

![](images/password_table.png) 

</center>

Click on the blue <a style="color:blue">*Change password*</a> button to force
corresponding user to change his/her password on the next log-in.

Click on the orange <a style="color:orange">*Reset password*</a> button to generate a temporary password. You are responsible for delivering such new password
to the user.

<br>

### Additional column definitions

- Must change column: Indicates whether the user has to change his/her password
next log-in.
- Have changed column: Indicates the user has already changed his/her password.
- Date change column: Indicates the date the password was updated.

<br>

## Have an issue?

That's all for the tutorial. If you have any issues or feature requests as it pertains to managing user IDs and passwords in the app, please open a new issue on our [Github repo](https://github.com/pharmaR/riskassessment/issues). Merry managing!
